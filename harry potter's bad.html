1.Revenue Generation
</font>
<br>
<font size=5 color="red">
Harry Potter movies have very less gross profit and their maximum ever was from<br> Harry Potter Deathly Hallows part 2 which only made a gross revenue of $1 billion.<br> Whereas Marvel Cinematic universe<br> has an average Gross revenue of $1 billion and their biggest hit,<br> The Avengers: Endgame had a gross profit of $2 billion. <br>DC comic's The Dark knight also got $1.005 billion dollars which is slightly higher than Harry potter movies

2. Action sequences of the final installations
</font>
<br>
<font size=5 color="red">
Action sequences of Endgame and Harry Potter 7 and Zack Snyder's Justice league are both amazing but the difference is<br> that Endgame consisted a huge cast in the final fight and all of the<br> people had different and unique powers<br>and Justice League also had grat action heroes which are the most popular these days, Batman and Superman.<br>Justice League's flash also had the amazing power to reverse the time in lightspeed which he does in the end to save all<br> whereas in Harry Potter 7, everybody were fighting with a wand and there were not so many exciting action sequences taking place<br> as compared to Marvel Cinematic Universe and the DC Extended Universe.

3. Wizardverse
</font>
<br>
<font size=5 color="red">
The MCU, DCEU and J.K.Rowling both have a big wizard universe but<br> MCU and DCEU has a bit more appealing illusions and magic in the Doctor Strange movies and the Shazam<br> whereas Harry Potter has bit less appealing.

4.Harry Potter is a Weaker Wizard
</font>
<br>
<font size=5 color="red">
Harry potter is a weaker wizard as compared to doctor strange or shazam because they are the only wizards to appear in the cinematic universe<br> Doctor Strange is stronger as he has the power of time, <br>and could even stand in front of the strongest bieng in their universe(thanos) and got defeated after thanos's so many tries.<br> Shazam is also stronger as he is said to be a match for superman who is supposed to be a God in thier universe.<br> So, if these both superheroes want to, they can squish harry potter in 10 minutes or so.<br> But they are only the wizards, if we directly compare to the strongest superheroes in their universes,<br>Sentry from Marvel comics and Martian Man hunter from dc comics can defeated him in a second.
